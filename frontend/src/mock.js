export const faqs = [
  {
    id: 1,
    question: 'How do you repair a damaged foundation?',
    answer: 'Groundhogs starts with a forensic examination to understand the root cause. We develop long-term solutions using Push Piers, PowerBraces, Earth Anchors and more. When needed, our team will replace your foundation using masonry or carpentry.'
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: 'Why is foundation repair important?',
    answer: 'The foundation holds up the whole building. When it sags or fails, everything above it bends or breaks. Timely repairs stop damage to walls, pipes, windows, and roofs, keeping property value high and protecting people from structural failure.'
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: 'Can a cracked foundation be repaired?',
    answer: 'Yes. Most cracks can be fixed if caught early. We fill small gaps with epoxy or polyurethane injections, add carbon-fiber straps to strengthen walls, and install piers to stop future movement.'
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: 'What is the best foundation repair method?',
    answer: 'There is no one-size-fits-all solution. Helical or push piers work for settling, carbon-fiber straps stop wall bowing, and slab lift injections fix floors. We pick the least invasive option for your needs.'
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: 'What is the highest cost for foundation repair?',
    answer: 'Depending on scale, costs can exceed $80,000. Full foundation rebuilds, severe damage, or work on large/historic properties drive costs higher. Get a professional assessment to understand your specific needs.'
