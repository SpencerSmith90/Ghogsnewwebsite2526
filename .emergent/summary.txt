The trajectory details the AI engineer's work on the Groundhogs application, transitioning from initial feature development to continuous improvements, SEO, and crucial bug fixes. Key accomplishments included integrating a new blog post, robust email notifications for contact forms, dynamic video carousels on the homepage, and updating branding elements like the company logo. The engineer successfully addressed routing and caching issues related to blog posts, deployed a dynamic sitemap, and debugged complex deployment-specific problems like photo upload persistence by implementing Cloudflare R2 storage. Throughout the process, the engineer demonstrated adaptability in addressing user feedback, such as refining blog content, fixing navigation issues, and providing detailed troubleshooting for DNS and email configuration. The current challenge revolves around re-establishing email notifications due to an invalid Gmail App Password after user-initiated DNS changes, marking a critical, ongoing task for the next phase of development.

The overarching goal is to establish an SEO-optimized, modern website for Groundhogs, offering foundation repair and waterproofing services with an integrated admin CMS to maximize search engine visibility.

**Implemented Features & Refinements:**
The application, built with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB, has evolved significantly. It now includes a comprehensive admin CMS, a blog system with multiple posts, a functional contact form with photo upload capabilities (persisting via Cloudflare R2), enhanced SEO (meta tags, structured data, dynamic sitemaps, Google Tag integration), and improved UI/UX elements. Recent additions include a Concentric Piers service page, revamped About and Blog pages, and multi-market SEO city landing pages for Thunder Bay, Winnipeg, and Sudbury. A dynamic video carousel on the homepage showcases company projects, and social media links (Facebook) are integrated. Logo display issues across devices were resolved, and site performance/optimization guidelines were provided. The current work involved troubleshooting email notification failures and DNS propagation issues.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving a critical issue where email notifications from the website's contact form were failing to send. The contact form itself was successfully saving submissions to the MongoDB database, but the email alerts to  were not being delivered.

The investigation revealed that the Gmail App Password, configured in the backend's  file (), was no longer being accepted by Gmail, resulting in a 5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted error (Chat Message 731, 742). This issue arose after the user had previously made DNS changes with the help of ChatGPT, which might have invalidated the existing App Password.

The AI engineer has already confirmed that updating the App Password will not disrupt the user's regular email service or DNS settings (Chat Message 733). The user provided a new App Password ( - Chat Message 734). The engineer updated the  file with this new password (Chat Message 736) and restarted the backend (Chat Message 738). A test submission was made (Chat Message 740), and the log indicates a persistent Username and Password not accepted error despite the new password (Chat Message 742).

The current state is that the email notification system remains non-functional, with the backend still reporting authentication failures with Gmail's SMTP server, even after updating the App Password as provided by the user.
